    "Gait Analysis (baseline approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim: Multi-class classification (16 subjects) using train/test split with SMOTE-based oversampling in pipeline - the first attempt/baseline approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source/Credit: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/604/gait+classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset\n",
    "- Size:         48 samples (16 subjects * 3 trials)\n",
    "- Features:     321 gait cycle measurements from 3 sensors (R1, R2, R3)\n",
    "- Target:       Subject identification (16 classes)\n",
    "- Missing data: 1 NA value in CycleTime_R2 (imputed with median)\n",
    "- Split:        67% train / 33% test -> ~2 training samples/class + 1 test sample/class \n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: Standard supervised learning pipeline:\n",
    "- Data Cleaning: Median imputation for missing value\n",
    "- Stratified Split: 67/33 train/test (ensures all classes represented)\n",
    "- Oversampling (in pipeline): SMOTEENN or SMOTETomek\n",
    "- Feature Scaling: StandardScaler normalization\n",
    "- Feature Selection: SelectKBest with mutual information (top ~10 features)\n",
    "- Model: Gaussian Naive Bayes (fixed hyperparameters)\n",
    "- Validation: Adaptive cross-validation (skipped when n<3 samples/class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Oversampling strategy\n",
    "- SMOTEENN: SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors (removes noisy synthetic samples)\n",
    "- SMOTETomek: SMOTE + Tomek Links (cleans class boundaries)\n",
    "- Fallback: RandomOverSampler when n_samples < 6 (too few for SMOTE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive CV: Smart handling of tiny dataset\n",
    "- If n_samples < 3: Skip CV, just train and evaluate on test\n",
    "- If n_samples >= 3: Use StratifiedKFold with n_splits = min(5, n_samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: Very poor performance \n",
    "- 0.00 recall/precision for many classes\n",
    "- Model never predicts certain classes\n",
    "- High variance, no generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Why This Failed\n",
    "1. Insufficient training data: only 2 training samples per class:\n",
    "    - Impossible to learn distinguishing patterns\n",
    "    - Model cannot identify what makes each subject unique\n",
    "    - Not enough examples to capture gait variability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unreliable evaluation: only 1 test sample per class:\n",
    "    - Single misclassification = 100% error for that subject\n",
    "    - Metrics are completely unstable\n",
    "    - Cannot distinguish signal from noise\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Oversampling limitations: SMOTE/SMOTEENN/SMOTETomek with 2 samples:\n",
    "    - Creates synthetic samples by interpolating between only 2 points\n",
    "    - Very limited diversity in synthetic data\n",
    "    - Essentially creates variations of the same 2 examples\n",
    "    - Cannot add meaningful new information\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "    - 321 features vs 32 training samples\n",
    "    - Features >> Samples (severe overfitting risk)\n",
    "    - Even after feature selection (10 features), ratio still problematic\n",
    "    - Model cannot learn reliable patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "What This Baseline Established\n",
    "1. Lessons Learned\n",
    "    - Proper methodology: No data leakage (oversampling in pipeline after split)\n",
    "    - Adaptive approach: Handles edge cases (n_samples < 3)\n",
    "    - Smart oversampling: Tests multiple methods with fallback\n",
    "    - Feature selection: Reduces dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fundamental Problems Identified\n",
    "    - Dataset too small: 48 samples insufficient for 16-class problem\n",
    "    - Train/test split wasteful: Loses 16 samples to test set\n",
    "    - Single split unstable: Results vary drastically with random_state\n",
    "    - Not person-independent: Tests on subjects seen during training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Comparison with later versions, what v1_1 did right\n",
    "    - Correct pipeline implementation (no data leakage)\n",
    "    - Stratified split preserves class balance\n",
    "    - Adaptive handling of tiny samples\n",
    "    - Tests multiple oversampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "What later versions improved \n",
    "- v1_2: Added GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, tested multiple models (KNN, SVC, Logistic, RandomForest, DecisionTree), no train/test split (uses all 48 samples)\n",
    "- v1_3: Tested aggressive oversampling (100 samples/class) to see if more synthetic data helps - showed it doesn't (BAD RESULT DUE TO OVERFITTING)\n",
    "- v1_4: Demonstrated data leakage by oversampling BEFORE split - educational example of what NOT to do (VERY BAD)\n",
    "- v1_5: Tested oversampling outside pipeline (**UPDATE**)\n",
    "- v1_6: Tested LOOCV with pre-CV oversampling (480 folds) - showed 99.4% accuracy but with data leakage (Invalid - educational)\n",
    "- v1_7: Removed train/test split, used StratifiedKFold (2-fold) with pipeline oversampling, tested multiple k values (2,3,4,5,10,15) - BEST APPROACH\n",
    "- v1_8: Same as v1_7 but with train/test split added back, showed why split is inferior for tiny data (88.2% accuracy, unstable)\n",
    "\n",
    "What v1_1 did right\n",
    "- Correct pipeline implementation (no data leakage)\n",
    "- Stratified split preserves class balance\n",
    "- Adaptive handling of tiny samples\n",
    "- Tests multiple oversampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "What v1_1 did that others avoided\n",
    "- Train/test split: Later versions realized this wastes data with only 48 samples\n",
    "- Fixed hyperparameters: v1_2 added systematic tuning\n",
    "- Single model: Later versions compared multiple algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid conclusions\n",
    "- Data scarcity is the problem: No amount of clever methodology can overcome 2 samples/class\n",
    "- Oversampling has limits: Cannot create meaningful diversity from 2 examples\n",
    "- Need different approach: Train/test split inappropriate for this dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid conclusions\n",
    "- Cannot conclude model quality (data too small to evaluate)\n",
    "- Cannot conclude feature quality (not enough samples to test)\n",
    "- Cannot conclude biometric viability (not person-independent anyway)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible solutions\n",
    "- Collect more data: 30-50 samples/subject minimum\n",
    "- Simplify problem: Binary classification instead of 16-class\n",
    "- Alternative approaches: Unsupervised learning, one-vs-rest\n",
    "- Use GroupKFold: Test person-independent performance\n",
    " \n",
    "This baseline established:\n",
    "- What proper methodology looks like (no leakage, stratified splits)\n",
    "- That the dataset is too small for reliable classification\n",
    "- Need for alternative approaches (led to v1_2, v1_7 improvements)\n",
    "\n",
    "> This was the starting point that established both the methodology and the fundamental challenge of working with extremely small datasets.\n"

    "Conclusion from this analysis:\n",
    "- Terrible model performance: 0.00 recall/precision for many of the 16 classes\n",
    "- The model never predicts these classes where recall/precision is 0.0\n",
    "- Only 1 test sample/class: completely unreliable evaluation\n",
    "- Only 2 training samples/class - impossible to learn patterns. \n",
    "- With only 2 training samples per class, the model can't learn distinguishing features\n",
    "- Even after oversampling, there's not enough diversity in the synthetic samples\n"
